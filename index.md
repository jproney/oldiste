      <p style="font-size: 22pt;">Hello, my name is James Roney. I'm from Santa Barbara, California, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Harvard University. I plan on graduating in 2022 with an A.B. Computer Science and Statistics. I like thinking about computational problems in the natural sciences, especially in neuroscience and systems biology. This website is some mixture of an extended CV, a blog, and a nice little project. Enjoy!</p>
